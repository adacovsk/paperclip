Adapter: claude_local

Core fields:
- cwd (string, optional): default absolute working directory fallback for the agent process (created if missing when possible)
- instructionsFilePath (string, optional): absolute path to a markdown instructions file injected at runtime
- model (string, optional): full Claude model id, e.g. claude-opus-5-5. The picker lists the models agents here ran in the last 30 days; type any other id.
- effort (string, optional): reasoning effort passed via --effort (low|medium|high)
- chrome (boolean, optional): pass --chrome when running Claude
- promptTemplate (string, optional): run prompt template
- maxTurnsPerRun (number, optional): max turns for one run
- dangerouslySkipPermissions (boolean, optional): pass --dangerously-skip-permissions to claude
- command (string, optional): defaults to "claude"
- extraArgs (string[], optional): additional CLI args
- env (object, optional): KEY=VALUE environment variables
- workspaceStrategy (object, optional): execution workspace strategy; currently supports { type: "git_worktree", baseRef?, branchTemplate?, worktreeParentDir? }
- workspaceRuntime (object, optional): workspace runtime service intents; local host-managed services are realized before Claude starts and exposed back via context/env

Operational fields:
- timeoutSec (number, optional): run timeout in seconds
- graceSec (number, optional): SIGTERM grace period in seconds

Notes:
- When Paperclip realizes a workspace/runtime for a run, it injects PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_* and PAPERCLIP_RUNTIME_* env vars for agent-side tooling.
